Winds generated by Tropical Cyclone George reached 154 km per hour at Port Hedland before the equipment failed. Temporary accommodation at a railway camp was severely damaged with some units breaking into pieces, causing greater damage. Of the 230 workers seeking shelter at the camp, which was 120 km south of Port Hedland, two died and 22 were injured. Damage was also reported at 3 mining camps, where 1000 people were cut off from rescuers by 275 km per hour winds.  An emergency situation was declared under the Emergency Management Act on 9 March to assist areas impacted by TC George, including the local government districts of Port Hedland, Roebourne and Ashburton.

"5",5,5,16,17,"Disaster Event","Storm/Flood","In June 2007 there were five east coast lows off the coast of New South Wales. The first and most severe occurred over 8-9 June. Heavy rain, strong winds and large ocean swells resulted in widespread damage to coastal regions of the Hunter, Central Coast and Sydney Metropolitan areas. The Queen's birthday weekend east coast lows developed in a pre-existing trough of low pressure over the northern Tasman Sea. This trough was directing a humid north-east to south-east air stream across north-east New South Wales and there was a weak low analysed just off the coast near Coffs Harbour on 8 June. The low moved south along the New South Wales coast, before moving out into the Tasman Sea on 10 June 2007.  Thunderstorms caused record breaking flooding in Newcastle, with 164.6 mm of rain falling in 6 hours from 3 pm to 9 pm, causing many shops and businesses to flood and hundreds of cars to be stranded or swept away. This storm event is often associated with the grounding of the Pasha Bulker (a 40,000 tonne bulk carrier ship) which occurred on 8 June on Nobbys Beach in Newcastle and was not re-floated until 2 July. Approximately 6000 people were evacuated from Maitland (near Newcastle) when it was considered that a levee may have burst.  In the Hunter Valley it was reported as the worst flooding in 52 years. Major flooding in the Hunter River occurred from 8 to 13 June and in the Paterson and Williams River from the 8 to 9 June. Moderate flooding occurred in the Wyong, Colo and Nepean Rivers.  Ferry services were cancelled on Sydney Harbour due to the weather conditions. The Cremorne wharf collapsed and sank due to large ocean swells. Beaches were eroded at many Sydney locations, due to swells up to 14 metres high. High winds blew beach sand over 100 metres inland. Over 200,000 homes reportedly lost power in the Sydney - Newcastle area due to flooding and high winds. Many thousands of homes and businesses lost telephone services when telephone exchanges were flooded.  A natural disaster was declared in the Hunter Valley and the Central Coast areas. There were a total of nine fatalities associated with the storm. Nearly 20,000 calls for assistance were made to the State Emergency Service.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 2007 damage at $1480 million, with the 2011 estimated normalised cost of $1742 million.","6/08/2007 0:00","6/10/2007 0:00",-32.92599487,151.7788696,NA,"",6000,0,0,9,1.48e+09,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"New South Wales",NA,"http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=17",NA,2,0,1
"6",6,6,17,18,"Disaster Event","Storm/Flood","In late June 2007, the Gippsland area received record rainfall associated with an intense low pressure system. The substantial rain event followed the Great Divide Bushfires, when 1.2 million hectares of public and private land were burnt and large areas of soil were left exposed.   The storm in June 2007 resulted in major flooding and widespread damage. Seven rivers burst their banks causing millions of dollars of damage to homes, businesses and farms, as well as a significant loss of public and private assets. The rapidly rising floodwaters forced dozens of rescues and evacuations. One person died as a result of the flood waters. During 48 hours of torrential rain more than 1000 emergency service staff worked to save homes and shops in towns throughout Gippsland. Relief centres were set up at Bairnsdale, Lakes Entrance, Paynesville, Sale, Lucknow and Loch Sport and housed up to 360 evacuees. Volunteers also provided medical aid and catering with other organisations such as the Lions Club.  The State Government established a Flood Recovery Ministerial Taskforce, which assessed community need and planned the recovery program. The Taskforce announced a $60 million Flood Recovery Initiative covering among other things the cost of work on some 400 roads, bridges and 80 walking tracks spanning hundreds of km and clearing debris from the regions&rsquo; water supplies, catchments and recreation areas.

"7",7,7,21,22,"Disaster Event","Bushfire","Victoria experienced a very adverse fire season during 2006 - 2007. Lightning ignited a number of fires on 1 December 2006 and some later merged to form what is known as the 'Great Divide Complex' fires in eastern Victoria. The area burnt mostly public land and was estimated to be in the vicinity of 1.2 and 1.3 million hectares by the end of the season. On 7 February 2007, The Great Divide fires were finally contained after 69 days. There were also a number of other fires (Tawonga Gap burned 33,500 hectares and Tatong burned 33,000). Despite the severity of the fire season, housing and private asset losses were remarkably low. In total, 51 dwellings of which 21 were classified as primary residences were destroyed and hundreds of stock and farm fencing were lost in the fires. One man died in a vehicle accident while assisting a property owner to prepare for fire impact.  Thousands of community volunteers and career emergency service personnel across state, regional and community levels worked in partnership to ensure the fires were eventually brought under control. A further component to the response was the support and assistance from New Zealand, United States, Canadian and interstate colleagues.  By 7 February, more than 1400 firefighters had been injured in the fire fighting effort (including bruises, cuts, blisters, burns, dehydration, broken limbs and spider bites). More than 400 St John Ambulance volunteers, including doctors, nurses and first aid officers provided medical assistance. On 16 December, 11 New Zealand firefighters were injured while fighting the fire in the Howqua Valley in north-east Victoria.  On 16 January 2007 power lines were cut which severely disrupted Melbourne electricity supplies. On the same day, a fire threatened to close Tullamarine Airport. The Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) worked with Melbourne Water to keep the fires out of the water catchments.  A significant number of people were evacuated during the fires. Relief centres were established to accommodate evacuees. Some mountain tourist complexes were evacuated due to fires including Mount Buller and Thredbo Village in New South Wales, the latter due to a fire that started from a lightning strike at Hermit Mountain and crossed the border.  Victoria experienced widespread effects from the fires. Numerous schools in the high country and some parts of Gippsland were forced to close due to the fire threat and outside play at school was banned in some instances due to smoke haze. The smoke haze reportedly caused some respiratory symptoms and aggravated conditions such as asthma. Haze also ffected traffic and delayed flights in and out of Melbourne airport. On 20 December, the Environment Protection Authority recorded its worst bushfire smoke since records began, with visibility reduced to two km in Melbourne's central business district.  During the fire season, the Country Fire Authority, Department of Sustainability and Environment and Parks Victoria received operational assistance from other states and a significant international contingent:    ACT - 37 personnel  NSW - 1050 personnel  NT - 108 personnel  SA - 10 personnel  Qld - 14 personnel  WA - 20 personnel  Canada - 52 personnel  New Zealand - 115 personnel  USA - 114 personnel    The Victorian and Federal Government provided financial assistance to aid personal, physical and economic recovery from the fire disaster.

The Victorian bushfire season had started in November 1982. There were 854 bushfires reported at this time including, Ballan, Mount Macedon on 1 February, Cann River and Mount Donna Buang.  On early Ash Wednesday morning there were 104 fires already burning in Victoria most controlled or contained, it was only after 2.00 pm that the situation exploded.  The Victorian fires formed several complexes.  1. Western district near Warrnambool. This fire started from a defective private power line. The resulting fire front was kilometres wide and moving at frightening speed. A cool change came through at 5.00 pm and the wind changed to the south-west. The fire headed toward the town of Terang. The fire passed the town to its north and was brought under control the next day. In total nine people died, 50,000 hectares burnt, 157 houses destroyed and 19,300 livestock was lost.  Another person died near Branxholme from a smaller fire caused by power line fault.  2. East Trentham&nbsp;- Macedon fire complex. This fire began around 2.00 pm near East Trentham due to two powerlines touching and sparking. The fire moved to the Wombat State Forest and burnt much of Bullengarook. The fire stalled for a while but upon wind change to the south-west the fire picked up again and headed toward Woodend with a 7 m fire front at 8.30 pm. It reached Macedon where people and animals sheltered in the Hotel protected by volunteers. The rest of the town was annihilated. After reaching the top of Mount Macedon it was controlled in an area that was previously burnt on 1 February. Seven people died, 20,000 hectares burnt, 200 homes destroyed in Macedon, 150 on Mount Macedon, 50 in Bullengarook and 20 in Woodend.  3. Otways complex. The fire broke out approximately 3.00 pm at Deans Marsh and moved toward Lorne eventually onto the ridges above the town on and down to the sand dunes with many people taking refuge in the sea. The fire moved to Aireys Inlet where the fibro houses were hit by walls of flame and a gigantic firestorm. The fire moved at extraordinary speed and next hit was Anglesea, where houses were lost but the main part of town was saved. The fire burnt on through the night toward Jan Juc and Torquay and was eventually contained early morning near Bellbrae. Three people were killed and 578 houses and other buildings were lost.  4. Upper Beaconsfield - Cockatoo complex. This fire began in Belgrave Heights south of Mount Dandenong. Half an hour later 10 km away, a fire started in Cockatoo and remained static until later that night. The first fire moved 15 km toward Berwick and Pakenham and firefighters were just beginning to gain control when the wind change came through at 8.30 pm redirecting the fire towards Upper Beaconsfield. Firefighters were caught in terrible circumstances leading to deaths. The Cockatoo fire began to flare at 7.30 pm. The fire went right through the town of Cockatoo as fire trucks had been called away to other fires. There were reports of women and children being sheltered and saved at a local kindergarten. The kindergarden&nbsp;building was later&nbsp;recorded by Heritage Victoria as a building of significance to be protected.&nbsp;In total, 27 people died, 100 were injured and 535 houses and buildings destroyed.  5.

Isolated parts of New South Wales, notably in the central west, suffered record low rainfall. In 1938 there was further deterioration in New South Wales and Victoria and it also spread to eastern South Australia and the south-west grain growing region of Western Australia where wheat yields plummeted to their lowest level since 1914.  In Victoria, a very dry six month period provided the right conditions for the disastrous Black Friday bushfires in January 1939. Heavy rain fell in late February 1939 over Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales, and for the remainder of the year abundant rain fell over eastern and central Australia. However dry weather occurred again and 1940 was one of the driest years of the century over most of the southern parts of the country. Dams were empty in New South Wales and Brisbane had water restrictions. January 1941 saw rain again, but by the second half of that year was again very dry. The following 12 months were good for general rain, but again dry conditions returned in 1943, and were worse again in 1944 when a failure of the wheat crop occurred in several places. The drought continued into 1945 and large rivers such as the Hunter were virtually dry. By April 1945 most Victorian water storage facilities were empty, the Murray river ceased flow at Echuca and Adelaide faced water shortages.  Financial losses were severe during this drought.

More than 40 fires were also started in New South Wales and Australia Capital Territory.  The majority of the area burnt in Victoria was public land, 1.19 million hectares of parks and forests, including 60 per cent of the Alpine National Park and 81 per cent of the Mt Buffalo National Park. Fire fighting efforts were made difficult in hard to access, remote forest terrain. Approximately 90,000 hectares of private land was burnt. The fires burnt nearly 800,000 hectares in New South Wales and Australia Capital Territory, bringing the total of land affected throughout the Australian Alps to approximately 2 million hectares. The immediate effects of the fires included reduced water quality and quantity, loss of vegetation and habitats, destruction of commercial timber infrastructure, damage to recreation and tourism infrastructure assets and destruction of cultural sites and farms adjacent to public land.  A Ministerial Taskforce, appointed by the Victorian Premier, announced a funding package of $70.6 million for recovery works on public land associated with natural and cultural assets and support for agricultural private landowners affected by the fires.

On 30 December 2007, a strong northerly wind change caused breakaways from the containment lines and the fire crossed the Great Eastern Highway from north to south. Roadblocks were established; however several escorted convoys of vehicles were permitted to travel through the fire area.  A convoy of vehicles from Coolgardie arriving at the eastern side of the fire, without an escort, drove into the fire area. Several trucks were engulfed in flames, resulting in three deaths.  The highway remained closed until containment lines were completed and a fall-back strategy was implemented on 9 January 2008. The final size of the fire was 39,630 ha.  An inquiry into the deaths found three dominating causes - the expectations of fire behaviour in shrubland fuels at night; the procedures for managing road blocks; and the strategic assessment of the fire's potential; but concluded that there were many complex, interacting contributing factors and extenuating circumstances that lead to the incident outcomes.","12/28/2007 0:00","1/08/2008 0:00",-31.23159218,120.1804733,NA,"",0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Western Australia",NA,"http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=498",NA,11,0,0

In total, 33 people lost their lives in flood and cyclone events and three people were still listed missing as of March 2012.  On 25 December 2010, Cyclone Tasha crossed the northern Queensland coast and brought disaster to every river system south of the Tropic of Capricorn and as far west as Longreach and Charleville.  The flooding engulfed Alpha, Jericho, Chinchilla, Dalby, Theodore, Warwick, Bundaberg, Gayndah, Munduberra, Emerald, Rockhampton, Condamine and St George. The Condamine River, the Balonne River, the Burnett River, the Comet River, the Dawson River and the Nagoa River reached flood peaks never before recorded.  On 10 January 2011 a wall of water swept through Toowoomba, then travelled west, flooding Oakey, Dalby, Chinchilla and Condamine for a second time, causing flooding through the Lockyer Valley, including Murphy&rsquo;s Creek, Postman&rsquo;s Ridge, Helidon, Grantham, Laidley, Lowood, Fernvale and Forrest Hill.  The floodwaters affected the Bremer, Lockyer and Brisbane River systems, reaching heights that engulfed Ipswich, Goodna, Gailes, Karalee and suburbs of Brisbane.  During this period approximately 3572 businesses were inundated.  There were 5900 people evacuated from 3600 homes. Commercial loss was approximately $4 billion across the mining, agriculture and tourism sectors. Nineteen thousand kilometres of roads were damaged. Three major ports were significantly affected. More than 28 per cent of the Queensland rail network was left twisted and displaced. An estimated 28,000 homes would need to be rebuilt while vast numbers of dwellings require extensive repairs.  The judicial inquiry into Queensland's floods started on 10 February 2011, a final report was published in March 2012.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimates the 2011 damage at $2.38 billion with an estimated total reserve of $3.71 billion.

On 30 January, it was named Yasi by the Fiji Meteorological Service. On 2 February, it was upgraded to a Category 5 system and made landfall near Mission Beach (138 km south of Cairns) between midnight and 1 am (AEST) early on Thursday 3 February. It weakened to a tropical low near Mount Isa around 10 pm on 3 February.  In response to warnings about the expected severity of the cyclone, and possible storm surges, approximately 10,000 northern Queenslanders living in low-lying areas evacuated to more than 100 official evacuation centres. Significant numbers were accommodated in unofficial evacuation centres established by communities and church groups. Thousands of people left the area and sought refuge with family and friends.  Flights out of the region were fully booked. The entire hospital population, more than 300 patients, were evacuated to other regional hospitals and Brisbane by the the Australian Defence Force, Royal Flying Doctor Service and other methods.&nbsp; This was an unprecedented evacuation effort.  The eye of the cyclone passed over Dunk Island and Mission Beach between Innisfail and Townsville bringing significant winds, the highest estimated at 285 km per hour. Considerable damage occurred to the towns of Tully, Cardwell, Tully Heads, Innisfail, Ingham, Mission Beach, El Arish, Silkwood and Silky Oak and localities, however, the cyclone&rsquo;s worst impact missed the major centres of Townsville and Cairns. Overall, approximately 1000 people reported significant damage to their homes. Other impacts include power loss to more than 200,000 properties, cars were found metres away from where they were left and boats were piled on top of each other in some regions.  Rainfall totals for the 24 hour period to 9 am Thursday 3 February were 200-300 mm in the area between Cairns and Ayr, causing some flooding. A 5 m tidal surge was observed at the storm tide gauge at Cardwell. Other sea inundation occurred between the beaches north of Cairns and Alva Beach, and there was some inundation in parts of the city of Townsville.  The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics and Sciences estimated the cyclone caused a $300 million hit to agriculture, particularly affecting banana and sugarcane crops.  The Federal Government processed over $250 million worth of recovery grants in the first three weeks after the storm through Centrelink. Financial help was also available in the form of concessional loans for cyclone hit farmers up to $650,000.  There was one recorded death.

"224",224,224,605,612,"Disaster Event","Storm/Flood","The combination of a high pressure system over the southern Tasman Sea and a trough over Queensland directed moist east to north-easterly winds across New South Wales. This generated patchy rain areas and isolated thunderstorms and heavy rain over the north of the state.  Minor to major flood warnings were issued for communities on the Mid North, Coffs Harbour and North Coast of New South Wales. There were reports of 300 mm falling in the space of three days in areas of the Bellinger River Valley and the Orara River catchment.  More than 2000 people were isolated by the rising floodwaters, with a number of road closures such as at the Pacific Highway and a caravan park in a low lying area evacuated.  From the 24 - 25 January New South Wales received almost 340 mm of rain. Overnight on the 24 January, the Tweed Valley saw heavy falls with 86 mm of rain at Couchy Creek, 100 mm at Numinbah and 100 mm at Bald Mountain.  Residents were isolated in the towns of Darkwood, near Coffs Harbour, the Thora and Kalang Valleys, and in Bellingen, on the Mid North Coast, where the flooded Bellinger River cut the town in two. More than a dozen homes and businesses in Bellingen were inundated. The Bellinger River at the Bellingen Bridge peaked at around 7 m, short of the 8.2 m that constitutes major flooding.  A landslide and waterfalls blocked the Waterfall Way between Dorrigo and Bellingen. Bellingen received 180 mm of rain in the 24 hours to 9 am on 27 January.  During this time the State Emergency Services received more than 1000 calls for assistance and over 50 flood rescues occurred.  By the beginning of February more than 16,500 people across the state were isolated, with the worst areas being Gunnedah and Wee Waa. Twenty-seven aircraft worked to supply those areas isolated.  On 5 February the Namoi River peaked at over 8 m in Gunnedah and the Mehi River near Moree reached more than 10.6 m, similar to the height reached in 1976 floods. Approximately 300 homes in Moree were inundated, and 1600 people were evacuated.  The concern became from floodwaters from Queensland moving downstream to northern areas of New South Wales such as Mungindi, Walgett, Bourke, Collarenebri and Brewarrina.  On 9 February, heavy rains caused flash flooding across western Sydney and the Illawarra, with the SES receiving approximately 450 calls for assistance.  On 20 February a similar event occurred with flash flooding across Sydney and the Illawarra prompting more than 300 requests for assistance to the SES. Terry Hills recorded 61 mm in an hour and Peakhurst recorded 26 mm in just ten minutes. Other suburbs affected included Banksia, Rockdale, Padstow Heights, Sylvania, Five Dock and Rosebery.  Up to 8000 people remained isolated for weeks in the north-west, receiving approximately 50 ton of daily deliveries such as medication, mail and food.  Heavy rains from the end of February to the beginning of March saw more than 75 per cent of New South Wales under water or threatened by floodwaters. Twenty-four hour rainfall totals to 9 am on 1 March reached up to 123 mm in Coolamon, 84 mm in Cootamundra, 83 mm in Broken Hill and widespread falls between 30 - 80 mm in the Illawarra district. Over 1700 people from the four towns of Bega, Eastgrove in Goulburn, Cooma and south-west Cowra were evacuated on 1-2 March.  Sydney's Warragamba Dam spilt at approx 6.53 pm on 2 March for the first time since 1998, causing authorities to cut power to 160 homes. The spillage prompted the evacuation of 1900 people from the Hawkesbury Nepean Valley area.The town of Pooncarie in western New South Wales received approximately 174 mm of rain and Ivanhoe 154 mm for the 48 hours to 9 am on Thursday, breaking two-day rainfall records.  In Towamba approximately 367 people were isolated following the closure of the Princes Highway.&nbsp;The SES responded to more than 740 requests for help as the large, slow-moving trough set in.&nbsp; Approximately 4600 people across the state were subject to evacuation orders and 2500 people were isolated, mostly on rural properties.  Approximately 9000 people were evacuated from Wagga Wagga and a state of emergency was declared as the town's flood levee was tested by a peak of 10.6 m on 6 March, risking inundation of more than 3000 properties.  Evacuations continued throughout the first week of March with approximately 236 people door knocked in the Lachlan River area, 600 people ordered to evacuate in Griffith, and flood evacuation orders issued for Forbes, Flowerdale, Urana, Barellan, Yenda, North Wagga, Gillenbah and parts of Gumly Gumly. The town of Forbes was cut in three by floodwaters, inundating dozens of businesses and homes in the CBD.More than 400,000 sandbags were distributed across New South Wales to protect communities from floodwaters.  The New South Wales Government declared 63 natural disaster zones during the February/March floods for the Albury, Balranald, Bathurst, Bega Valley, Berrigan, Bland Shire, Blacktown, Blayney, Bogan, Bombala, Boorowa, Broken Hill, Cobar, Cabonne, Carrathool, Central Darling, Conargo, Coolamon, Cooma-Monaro, Cootamundra, Corowa, Cowra, Forbes, Goulburn, Greater Hume, Griffith, Gundagai, Harden, Hawkesbury, The Hills, Hay, Jerilderie, Junee, Lachlan, Leeton, Lithgow, Lockhart, Mid-western, Murray, Murrumbidgee, Narrandera, Narromine, Oberon, Palerang, Parkes, Penrith, Queanbeyan, Shellharbour, Shoalhaven, Snowy River, Temora,&nbsp;Tumbarumba ,Tumut, Mid Western Regional, Unincorporated Area of NSW, Upper Hunter, Upper Lachlan, Urana, Wagga Wagga, Weddin, Wentworth, Wollongong, Yass and Young local government areas.  Approximately 30 towns across the state's north-east were inundated, leaving 1000 properties isolated.&nbsp;Almost 2000 homes were flooded and more than 17,000 people requested emergency assistance.  On 12 March the Insurance Council of Australia stated that insurers had already received claims totalling more than $64 million from flood-affected homeowners in Victoria and New South Wales. Insurers received 8,200 claims across the declared catastrophe zone.&nbsp;On 31 January one person drowned when they attempted to drive through floodwaters 1.6 m deep.  On 4 March one person died and two others were admitted to hospital with hypothermia and severe bruising after their four wheel drive was caught in a swollen causeway near Braidwood in the Southern Tablelands.  On 9 March one person was found dead in floodwaters north of Bourke, and their vehicle partially submerged in a causeway.  To date the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments total approximately $17,256,000 allocated to 14,834 claimants&nbsp; affected in the northern part of the state and&nbsp;$29,991,000 was allocated&nbsp;to pay over 28,860 claimants affected by flood in the southern New South Wales region.  &nbsp;  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 2012 damage at $108.2 million which incorporated figures for both New South Wales and Victoria.

"225",225,225,606,613,"Disaster Event","Storm/Flood","From 24 January 2012, south-east Queensland experienced very high rainfall across the region with totals up to 200 mm recorded in a 24 hour period.&nbsp; Floods occurred in some areas and homes were evacuated, power outages occurred and several roads were closed as the heavy rain continued.  The State Emergency Service (SES) received approximately 500 requests for assistance between midnight and 4 pm across south-east Queensland. The SES efforts focused on the north side of Brisbane, in Boondall, Zillmere, Herston and Aspley. Most requests for assistance were for minor damage to properties and general and storm damage.&nbsp;On 24 January, evacuation centres were opened at Narangba and Deception Bay, north of Brisbane. Twelve homes were evacuated as a precaution at Burpengary, north of Brisbane, and another dozen homes were flooded further north on the Sunshine Coast. Power was cut to approximately 9500 homes and businesses across the south-east. Overnight Upper Springbrook recorded some of the heaviest rain falls, with 193 mm in the 12 hours to 6 am. Lower Springbrook recorded 173 mm, Upper Tallebudgera 142 mm and 127 mm at Mt Tamborine. Brisbane city and suburbs had between 80 and 120 mm of rain and Caloundra on the Sunshine Coast recorded 271 mm in just ten hours.  Thirteen dams across south-east Queensland began spilling water to cope with the deluge, which included 220 mm falls over 30 hours in some parts.  Council run Australia Day events planned for the Moreton Bay Region and for the Gold Coast's Evandale Parklands were forced to cancel due to the heavy rain.  The State Emergency Services received more than 650 calls for assistance on the morning of 27 January.   On 3 February a state of emergency was declared in Mitchell and approximately a quarter of the population was evacuated.. The Queensland Government requested assistance from the Australian Defence Force to provide aerial support and aid evacuations. The Maranoa River reached 9.85 m, breaking its 1956 record peak of 9.26 m. Almost half the population took refuge in a sports complex and when the flood threatened to isolate the complex helicopters were sent in to air-lift people to safety.  By 4 February the Warrego River in Charleville reached 7.7 m and over 280 homes were inundated when floodwaters in Roma peaked at 8.35 m. Approximately 50 per cent of homes experienced some form of inundation. More than 700 homes or businesses in the region needed assistance, and more than 440 were damaged with approximately 288 properties affected in Mitchell and 290 affected in Roma. One hundred and twenty Australian Defence Force soldiers assisted with the clean up in these regions.  On 5 February mandatory evacuations were ordered for St George after it was predicted the Balonne River would peak at up to 15 m. With more than 2600 people from a population of 3000 evacuated, it was Queensland&rsquo;s largest evacuation in history. The Balonne River in St George passed its previous record of 13.48 m, peaking at 13.93 m, but the township remained protected by its 14.5 m levee with damage restricted to the 50 homes. St George also faced pollution problems as floodwaters damaged the local sewerage treatment plant, posing a major public health risk.  At the beginning of March, a category one cyclone off the south-east coast caused further flooding and six evacuation centres were opened across the coast to assist evacuated and displaced people.  The National Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA) identified the Local Government Areas of Aurukun, Burdekin, Burke, Cairns, Carpentaria, Cassowary Coast, Charters Towers, Cook, Doomadgee, Hinchinbrook, Kowanyama, Mackay, Mapoon, Mornington, Napranum, Northern Peninsula, Palm Island, Pormpuraaw, Tablelands, Townsville City, Torres Strait Islands and Yarrabah as natural disaster zones. To date the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments total approximately $11,749,000 allocated to 10,293 claimants.  On 3 January one person died when their car was swept off a causeway into floodwaters in Roma. Another person died on 5 March after being swept away by waters near Gympie, north of Brisbane.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the preliminary 2012 damage at $124.7 million.

"226",226,226,608,615,"Disaster Event","Storm/Flood","Heavy rain began in Victoria on 26 February 2012. A severe weather warning for flash flooding was issued for most of the state, including the South West, North Central, Northern Country, Wimmera, Mallee, Central, West and South Gippsland and North-East forecast districts.  The State Emergency Service (SES) responded to 650 calls for help across the state on the last days of February following heavy rain and thunderstorms. There was flash flooding and minor building damage across the state after rainfalls of between 50 and 100 mm. In towns such as Seymour there was 120 mm of rain causing flash flooding and road closures. Shops in the main street of Chiltern were flooded after 94 mm of rain fell. The Goulburn Valley Highway was closed north of Seymour due to rainfall. Broken Weir near Benalla recorded the highest rainfall with 167 mm. Castlemaine received 50 mm of rain in a 90 minute period. Police said 11 homes and six shops were flooded.  State Emergency Service (SES) crews were also kept busy dealing with flash flooding at Yarrawonga, Cobram and Shepparton. In addition they had over 350 calls for help in Melbourne, with the hardest hit areas including Brimbank, Doncaster, Emerald and Malvern. There were 89 calls for help in the Ballarat area when storms dumped almost 60 mm of rain. The Daylesford Hospital had some minor flooding, and streets and at least one building were flooded in the area.  On 1 March 2012, the Bureau of Meteorology issued a Severe Weather Warning for heavy rain for residents in the Northern Country, East Gippsland and North East forecast districts.  Broken Creek&nbsp;broke its banks&nbsp;and flooded the town of&nbsp;Numurkah, north of Shepparton.&nbsp;Numurkah Base Hospital and the adjoining Karinya Nursing Home both experienced flooding, with&nbsp;patients and residents evacuated.&nbsp;Flood waters peaked on 5 March and slowly receded with a State Emergency Service spokeswoman saying it would take at least a week for the water to recede completely. Approximately 40 homes and businesses were damaged. The hospital was later delared unsalvagable and limited services resumed from a temporary tent facility, followed by longstanding portables.  Locals and the SES in Nathalia constructed a temporary metal levee with thousands of sandbags, 750 m in length along the banks of Broken Creek, in an attempt to protect the town. Nathalia's temporary levee was purchased after floods hit the town in 1993; it has not been used until this event and it supplements a permanent levee around much of the Nathalia stretch of Broken Creek. Notwithstanding the levee the SES still issued an evacuation order for the town of Nathalia as some doubt existed as to the levees ability to contain the flood waters.  Flooding of Broken Creek, which flanks Nathalia, peaked on 9 March at 3.25 m. The town's evacuation notice was lifted 15 March 2012 and the metal levee dismantled on 20 March 2012.  To date the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments total approximately $7,773,000 allocated to 6897 claimants.

A storm surge of around 2 m occurred at Denham, inundating the foreshore. Several fishing vessels were stranded along the main street when water levels subsided. As the cyclone moved inland, severe dust storms occurred on its northern side, while by contrast rainfall totals greater than 100 mm caused flooding.

On 18 January, two fire fronts combined to create a 25 km fire front and wind gusts of up to 65 km per hour propelled the fire towards Canberra. The Chief Minister declared a state of emergency at 2.45 pm and the firestorm hit the outer streets of Duffy at approximately 3 pm, and soon reached the suburbs of Rivett, Chapman, Kambah, Higgins, Hawker and Cook.  Four people were killed by the fires, more than 435 people&nbsp;were injured and there were 5000 evacuations. Approximately 160,000 hectares were burnt which equated to almost 70 per cent of the ACT's pasture, forests and nature parks including Namadgi National Park, Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve and all government pine forest west of the Murrumbidgee River Stromlo pine plantation. There were approximately 488 houses destroyed and many more were damaged.  The Chief Minister and Cabinet Inquiry into the Operational Response to the January 2003 bushfires made 61 recommendations.

Many Gippsland locations received a month's rainfall in one day. Up to 100 residents in low-lying parts of Traralgon evacuated their homes when the Traralgon Creek flooded, 45 homes were flooded.  The main road through the region, the Princes Highway, was closed between Rosedale and Traralgon and also east of Orbost due to flood.&nbsp;Wind gusts of up to 150 km per hour brought down trees and blocked parts of the South Gippsland and Monaro highways.  Major flood warnings were issued for the Avon, Macalister, Mitchell, Thomson, Tanjil and Buchan Rivers and the Traralgon Creek. The Yallourn coal mine flooded when the Morwell River burst its banks on early June impacting on coal conveyers and therefore the operation of electricity generators. The operator TRUenergy announced it should be able to restore three of the plant's four generators by the end of June.  The State Emergency Service received 1200 requests for assistance across the state including 450 calls for trees that had fallen and blocked traffic.  Early estimates of flood damage are being assessed, but damage to council infrastructure alone is expected to exceed $10 million. The Department of Human Services paid out Government grants totaling $125,000 to flood-affected residents.  The Victorian Governments Deputy Premier Peter Ryan announced emergency flood assistance grants. Adults are entitled to $480 and children $240, up to a total of $1200.  A media release by the then Federal Attorney-General, Nicola Roxon on 28 June 2012 stated that Victorians affected by flooding in South-Eastern Metropolitan Melbourne and West Gippsland on 22-24 June 2012&nbsp;would be able to get financial assistance in the five local government areas of Baw Baw, Bass Coast, Cardinia, Latrobe and South Gippsland.

A further storm hit 10 June with winds of up to 140 km per hour lashing the south-west. Hundreds of power lines, street light wires and service wires came down in the storm. Some residents were warned they maybe without electricity for up to a week after more than 110,000 homes were affected. The weather bureau described the storm as a 'once in a decade' event.  In Bunbury, cars, buildings and infrastructure were damaged. Residents reported damage to houses, downed power lines, and debris spread across roads.  The State Emergency Service received hundreds of calls for help, mostly for damaged roofs and powerlines.  A man died after falling from a storm damaged roof south of Perth.  On 12 June, a third severe storm hit southern Western Australia in a week. Winds up to 113 km per hour, thunder and heavy rain caused power outages to 34,000 properties throughout the state. The storm hit the Perth metropolitan area at approximately 9.30 pm (AWST), bringing wind gusts of 107 km per hour as well as heavy rain and thunder for most of the night.

A further slow moving tropical low caused extensive flood damage to infrastructure across the Fitzroy, Ord and Pentecost River catchments areas.  A number of towns in the Kimberley region broke their highest March rainfall records including Warmun, Yulmbu and Gibb River.  In the east Kimberley town of Warmun up to 500 people were evacuated when the town's 76 houses were either destroyed or deemed uninhabitable through flood inundation.&nbsp;Within days more than 290 members of the Warmun community were evacuated to the Ord Stage II Camp (Garrjang) in Kununurra.  The Western Australian state government immediately pledged the initial sum of $500,000 to contribute toward the rebuilding of the town. The state government further contributed $15 million to construct a 200 bed temporary accommodation for the community. The federal government committed to reimburse 50 per cent of the cost through the National Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements.&nbsp;  The Department of Housing allocated $9.5 million to repair the damaged roads and create new roads to the newly built replacement homes. The town also received more than $8 million from the federal government to help with recovery. The funding would be provided over two years under the Community Development Employment Projects program. Funds were allocated towards projects to enhance the economic and social development of the community, such as rebuilding and creating opportunities for locals to develop work skills to contribute to their community.

"243",243,243,640,3413,"Disaster Event","Bushfire","In early January 2013 up to 40 fires were burning throughout Tasmania in hot windy conditions. The main fire that started near Forcett caused significant damage to local townships, particularly Dunalley, east of Hobart, where more than half of the town&rsquo;s buildings and a primary school were destroyed. Other significant fire fronts were located at Lake Repulse and Bicheno.  The Forcett fire was first reported in bushland outside the town heading towards Dunalley, on Thursday 3 January 2013 at approximately 2.00 pm. The fire escaped containment lines the following afternoon fanned by strong winds and burned towards the coast at several points. More than 100 properties were destroyed and 2500 hectares of land were burnt by the afternoon of 6 January. At least 80 properties were either damaged or destroyed in Dunalley and nearby Boomer Bay, approximately 20 houses were destroyed at Murdunna and 40 per cent of structures were lost at Connelly&rsquo;s Marsh. The fire threatened the town of Taranna and on 14 January 2013 a Victorian volunteer firefighter was killed when undertaking back burning operations in the vicinity. An estimated 24,000 hectares were burnt in the fire and at its peak the perimeter of the fire approximated 200 km.  Thousands of locals and tourists were stranded as a result of the Forcett bushfire which effectively cut the Tasman Peninsula off from the rest of the state. The peninsula's main access road, the Arthur Highway, was closed from 4&nbsp;to 13 January. People converged on Port Arthur to await evacuation by sea or road and due to shortages of food and other supplies, the community arranged for a fleet of boats to make deliveries to those stranded on the peninsula. Two private catamaran operators in Hobart were asked by police to help evacuate people from the Nubeena jetty.&nbsp; Evacuees were then taken to Hobart where they were met by relatives and friends or taken in by volunteers.  The Highway was partially opened on 11 January to allow stranded people and supplies to get through and was eventually opened to general traffic on 13 January.  Community refuges were established at the Sorrell Memorial Hall, Nubeena Community Centre, Bicheno Community Hall and Swansea Football Ground. There was also a Recovery Centre established at City Hall, Hobart.  The electricity company, Aurora, reported approximately 300 electricity poles were destroyed on the Tasman Peninsula, consequently power outages are expected to be an issue for a considerable time.  Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments were made available to residents in the south-east and east of Tasmania, covering the affected local government areas of Sorell, Tasman and Glamorgan-Spring Bay. Other grants made available were immediate cash assistance grants, housing assistance grants, Aurora energy assistance and clean-up and assistance grants. A first stage recovery payment from the Red Cross Appeal Distribution Committee was distributed, providing $3000 per adult and $1000 per child by late January. The Department of Human Services has allocated over $7,845,000&nbsp;to cover approximately 6900 claims.  The Insurance Council of Australia advised as at 1 February 2013 that 1783 insurance claims had been received with losses estimated at $86.7 million, about 85 per cent of these related to property, seven per cent for domestic vehicles, with the balance consisting of smaller claims for other losses.  The fire at Lake Repulse burnt more than 12,000 hectares and threatened the towns of Ellendale Ouse, Karanja, Westerway and Hamilton. Police allege it was started by an unattended campfire. The fire burnt for up to two weeks and was handed back to regional firefighters when conditions eventually improved. The other significant fire front was at Bicheno and Coles Bay where up to 15 properties were lost.  These fires were described as the worst in almost half a century. On 14 January a Tasmanian Bushfire Recovery Taskforce was established and the state moved to recovery mode. The taskforce estimated that rebuilding communities could take up to two years, with contractors expected to start clearing damaged properties by the end of January.

The lodge at the Siding Spring Observatory in the National Park was damaged along with other buildings. However, Australia's largest telescope the Anglo-Australian survived.  The other major areas affected by fire were Yass, Cooma and the Shoalhaven. One house was destroyed in Jugiong and a volunteer firefighter sustained burn injuries in Gundaroo and was airlifted to Sydney for hospital treatment.  A recovery centre was opened in Coonabarabran after the fire. A recovery coordinator was appointed on 21 January by Barry O&rsquo;Farrell concentrating on supporting the Warrumbungles fire affected community.  Approximately 131,000 hectares were burnt in total across the state and extensive farm infrastructure and fences damaged. Approximately 12,000 sheep were lost at an estimated cost of over $1,000,000. Wildlife losses were also significant. The Department teamed with farmers to establish a fodder and fencing donation register to assist farmers rebuilding after the fires.

The following morning, as the cyclone moved inland it was downgraded to a tropical low system. The low moved toward the east coast, near Cooktown on 23 January and then tracked slowly to the south-south-east just inland from the coast, impacting areas near Townsville on 24 January. The weather system stalled over the St. Lawrence-Rockhampton area on the 25th and 26th, and then tracked south to near Dalby west of Brisbane on the 28th, finally accelerating in a southerly direction eventually moving offshore south of Sydney on 29 January.  The ex-tropical cyclone brought with it a heavy monsoonal rainfall system that lasted for approximately one week. Most of the eastern areas of Queensland, and the coast of New South Wales ending in the Wollongong area experienced very heavy rainfall during the period from 22 to 29 January 2013. On 25 January, areas around Rockhampton recorded rainfall for a 24 hour period in excess of 300 mm. Rainfall for the areas between Rockhampton and Bundaberg alone were heavy enough to break the January monthly rainfall records. On 28 January, the most extreme daily rainfall for the week occurred over the Gold Coast Hinterland and New South Wales border catchment and the edge of the Brisbane river catchment where rainfall for a 24 hour period was in excess of 700 mm both hitting record levels. The Queensland State Emergency Service received 1800 calls for help in 24 hours on the 28 January, mostly in the south-east areas of the state.  Six people were killed due to the extreme weather over the course of the week. Thousands were forced to evacuate, 2000 people were isolated by floodwaters for some days requiring emergency supply drops. Approximately 40 water rescues took place by State Emergency Service volunteers.  Key infrastructure was damaged and destroyed, estimated to cost hundreds of millions of dollars.

Winds reached 131 km per hour at Cape Byron.&nbsp;Mt Crosby water treatment plant was shut down owing to turbidity in the Brisbane River. Water was released from the Wivenhoe dam from 91per cent to 88 per cent to cope with flood waters. Water was also released from North Pine Dam and Somerset Dam.  Torrential rainfall and flooding also occurred in northern New South Wales particularly near Lismore and Grafton where approximately 2000 evacuations occurred. The New South Wales State Emergency Service attended to&nbsp;more than&nbsp;2900 calls for assistance Eight New South Wales river systems had flood warnings in place. Coastal erosion of beaches was evidenced in these regions along with sea foam covering some roads and parks on the Gold and Sunshine Coasts.  Overall, Bundaberg was the worst affected city with 2000 homes and 200 businesses inundated with flood water. The Burnett river was running at approximately 70 km per hour and threatening houses. Despite a mandatory evacuation order issued to 5000 residents, an emergency airlift was the only option for some stranded residents. Eighteen helicopters were utilised in a rescue effort evacuating more than 1000 people trapped by flood waters in North Bundaberg and other most-at-risk areas to at least nine evacuation centres which was a record evacuation effort in Australia. The Bundaberg hospital was also evacuated and approximately 130 patients were transferred to hospitals in Brisbane.  On 31 January, in North Bundaberg, approximately 7000 residents were forced out of their homes and not allowed to return until they were checked and declared safe. Defence personnel, 180 in total, went house to house within an exclusion zone, conducting search and rescue operations. Defence personnel also helped to repair damaged infrastructure and clean people's homes as part of the initial recovery operation.  Financial assistance and grants were made available to eligible Queensland flood victims, including:    Queensland Floods Appeal 2013 payments  Emergent Assistance Grant  Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP)  Essential Services Safety and Reconnection Grant.

The State Emergency Service received approximately 150 calls for assistance during this period, most requiring help with fallen trees blocking roads or damaging houses. The Hume Freeway, near Benalla, and the Murray Valley Highway at Bundalong were forced to close for a period of time until fallen trees were cleared. Disruptions occurred to local power and telecommunications services.  Approximately fifteen homes were deemed uninhabitable in Koonoomoo, seven in Bundalong and two in Rutherglen. Fourteen properties were badly damaged in Bundalong and 19 other properties sustained damaged across the region. It is estimated over 100 caravans were damaged by the wind.

Many of the growers who were long-term residents of the region, commented that they had never seen a flood this size before.  &nbsp;","11/08/2005 0:00","11/08/2005 0:00",-34.64535522,138.5066986,NA,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"South Australia",NA,"http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=4166",NA,0,0,0
"249",249,249,654,4212,"Disaster Event","Drought/Heatwave","From late December 2012 to early January 2013, Australia experienced a nationwide heatwave. Temperatures peaked throughout Australia, forcing the Bureau of Meteorology to add new colours (deep purple and pink) to its weather forecasting chart to record temperatures above 50&deg;C.  Australia&rsquo;s first six days of 2013 were among the hottest 20 days on record in terms of average maximums. The heatwave developed over a large region stretching from northern Victoria and inland New South Wales to central-west Queensland, across to north-western Western Australia and down to the Nullarbor coast.The national average maximum across Australia on 7 January was 40.33 &deg;C, beating the previous record set in 1972 by 0.16&deg;C.  In Perth, temperatures exceeded 37&deg;C for seven consecutive days. This heatwave caused 20 people to be hospitalised between the period 27 December and 3 January. St John Ambulance reported a doubling in call-outs for heatstroke, dehydration and burns from the previous week. On New Year&rsquo;s Eve, Western Australia recorded 42.1 &deg;C, 13 &deg;C above the December average. The state's average temperature for the last week of 2012 averaged a maximum of 39.3 &deg;C, making it the hottest week in 80 years.&nbsp;Records were broken in Alice Springs, with temperatures over 40 &deg;C for 17 days in a row and Oodnadatta, where temperatures exceeded 45 &deg;C for seven consecutive days.  On 17, January Sydney endured its hottest day ever, with a record temperature of 45.8 &deg;C. The Ambulance Service of New South Wales reported that more than 220 people had been treated for heat exposure or fainting. The heatwave stranded thousands of commuters, with dozens of trains delayed as steel wires buckled and a hose used to run a key signalling system melted. On the central coast, the heat caused an overhead wire to buckle onto a train at approximately 1.30 pm, trapping about 250 passengers for half an hour.  There was a noted increase in nationwide hospital admissions for kidney disease, acute renal failure and heart attacks across this period. The Bureau of Meteorology stated the heatwave was an exceptional event.","12/27/2012 0:00","1/19/2013 0:00",-25.24469566,133.59375,NA,"",0,0,240,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Queensland;New South Wales;Victoria;South Australia;Western Australia",NA,"http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=4212",NA,23,0,0

"253",253,253,664,4781,"Disaster Event","Bushfire","During October 2013, approximately 100 fires burnt across eastern New South Wales, including six major bushfires. The most serious fires started in the Blue Mountains on 16 and 17 October.  The fires began on 13 October when strong winds and high temperatures caused a fire near Port Stephens and destroyed six houses. Several sheds and cars were also burnt in the fires and dozens of residents spent the night in evacuation centres. One person died at Lake Munmorah while protecting their home. Fires also occurred around the Hunter and Hawksbury regions. At the same time, more than 100 firefighters were fighting bushfires at Tangory Mountain, Webbs Creek, Wollemi National Park, the Southern Highlands and the Central Coast.  On 16 October, a defence training exercise at Marrangaroo near the Blue Mountains, accidently sparked a fire that became known as the &lsquo;State Mine Fire&rsquo;. It had a perimeter of 190km and eventually burnt nearly 46,000 hectares between Lithgow and Mt Tomah. At its most severe, the fire travelled 25 km per hour through bushland.  Thousands of people in Lithgow were evacuated and the communities of Bell, Bilpin, Berambing, Clarence, Dargan, Hartley Vale, Mount Wilson were also affected. The fire devastated the recently restored tourist attraction, Zig Zag Railway, with equipment and train carriages destroyed.  On 17 October two more major fires began in the lower Blue Mountains: one near Mt Victoria and the other at Springwood. Wimallee and Yellowrock were the worst affected communities with 193 homes destroyed and 100 damaged. Staff and patients at the Springwood Hospital were evacuated as a precaution. With the three fires burning uncontrollably in the Blue Mountains, on 18 October, Victoria sent fire crews and equipment to assist with the NSW firefighting efforts. A State of Emergency was announced for NSW on 20 October.  By 22 October the State Mine Fire had travelled south and was threatening to join up with the Mt Victoria Fire. The Rural Fire Service decided to deliberately allow the State Mine Fire to join the Mount Victoria Fire in a controlled way by managing fuel loads and back-burning to create firebreaks. While this was a high risk strategy, by 25 October cooler weather conditions allowed firefighters to bring the three Blue Mountains Fires under control. The fires were declared extinguished on 13 November. A total of approximately 118,000 hectares was burnt across the state.  A second person died on 24 October while piloting a water-bombing plane that crashed over Budawang National Park.

The excessive heat and strong winds fuelled the fire which quickly grew out of control and spread from Parkerville to Stoneville and Mount Helena. A total of 650 hectares were burnt.  Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes and sought shelter at centres set up in Mundaring and Swan View. Many residents were unable to return and assess the damage to their homes until 15 January when the extensive clean-up of debris and fallen power poles was complete. As of 16 January, 450 homes were still without electricity. It is believed that the fire was started by a fallen power pole.  A man died on the Sunday while protecting his home.  Financial assistance and grants were made to eligible Perth Hills bushfire victims, with Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments of $384,800 scheduled to be paid.

It was one of 68 fires burning across Victoria during this time.  The fire coincided with a heatwave across Victoria with temperatures reaching over 40 C in the Grampians region from 15 - 20 January. The fire eventually burnt 52,000 hectares including bushland and farms and was declared contained on 21 January 2014. Many residents from Dadswell&rsquo;s Gap, Wartook, Brimpean, St Helen&rsquo;s Plain, Roses Gap Pomonal, Bellfield, Lake Fyans, Lake Lonsdale, Heatherlie and Ledcourt were affected by the fires. Halls Gap was threatened by the fire front and ember attack and most of the town evacuated. Relief centres were set up in Horsham, Stawell and Ararat for the hundreds of people who were evacuated from their homes. Farmers lost large numbers of sheep that were either killed by the fire or later culled. At least 7000 sheep in total were lost.  A 12 km wide pyro cumulus cloud column of smoke and fire was created by the fire, generating its own weather pattern including lightning and thunder. This cloud gathered burning embers into the sky, which then scattered for many kilometres beyond the fire front, potentially starting new fires.  Once the fire was contained, emergency services began assisting people to return to their homes and cleaning up the tourist attractions in time for visitors to be able to come to the Grampians National Park over the Australia Day long weekend.  Financial assistance for people in bushfire affected communities was provided under the jointly funded Commonwealth-Victorian Natural Disaster Relief Recovery Arrangements.

It was the first heatwave to be classified under the Bureau of Meteorology&rsquo;s new modelling system of Heatwave, Severe Heatwave and Extreme Heatwave.  During the next two weeks, both states experienced the numerous effects of extreme heat. In South Australia, 13-17 January recorded the first ever five-day period above 42 &deg;C, the hottest maximum five-day average temperature of 43.6 &deg;C and on 16 January, Adelaide was the hottest city in the world, at 46 &deg;C. In the same period, Victoria recorded its first ever four-day period above 41&deg;C and its hottest four-day average maximum temperature at 43.1 &deg;C.  The Bureau of Meteorology released a Special Climate Statement for the period from 13 to 18 January and stated that the heatwave was more notable for persistent heat than individual extreme hot days.  Heat-related power outages affected approximately 35,000 people in Victoria during the evening of 14 January, while about 5000 South Australian residents&nbsp;were temporarily without electricity.  The heatwave resulted in 275 people being admitted to South Australian hospitals for heat-related conditions. In Victoria, 505 people were treated by Ambulance Victoria for heat exhaustion, and 208 people were treated for cardiac arrest, at one time cardiac arrest calls being received every six minutes. More than 1000 spectators&nbsp;required treatment for heat exhaustion at the Australian Open, which was held from 13 to 26 January.

Six thousand firefighters were mobilised across the state and thousands of people evacuated.  High winds and very dry conditions resulted in three homes&nbsp;destroyed in Warrandyte, one in Gisborne and one in Morwell before these fires were brought under control. However, a fire in the Hazelwood Mine at Morwell continued to burn (see the Hazelwood Mine entry for further information on this disaster).  The Mickleham Road Complex was a fast moving grassfire that remained out of control for a number of days. It split into two fire-fronts threatening both Kilmore and Wallan. The fire also impacted the communities of Beveridge, Darraweit Guim, Springwood, Chintin, Forbes and Bylands, Wallan, Willowmavin and Craigieburn. Once the Mickleham fire was contained, the threat of smouldering trees falling continued amongst the fire affected areas.
